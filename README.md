# DSA210-Term-Project-Correlife
The main goal behind this project is to understand the relation between daily activity patterns using personal data. By analyzing various metrics such as step count, screen time, workdays and exam days my purpose is to gain insight that how different factors influence each other by numbers. By working on this project I also had chance to increase my understanding on the course named DSA 210 which is a introduction course to data scienece and analysis. The knowledge will be harden durring this process.


# Data Sources

The dataset used in this project was collected over a 90-day period. It contains daily records of: 

1) Calories burned (Kj)
2) Step Count (steps)
3) Workday status (1 for workdays, 0 otherwise)
4) Exam day status (1 for workdays, 0 otherwise)
5) Screen time on PC, mobile and total screen time (hours,minute)
6) Days of the week (R = Thursday, N = Sunday)

Calories and step counts data obtained by a App Store app named Health Auto Export - JSON + CSV. By this app and also 7 days free trial I managed to pull 90 days of data. Workdays and exam dates are signed mannualy and also the screen time of your devices in Apple is being stored by default. The last 30 days of screen time records can be viewved before being deleted. So I recorded my screen times regularly to some point including both my Iphone and Macbook screen times. 

These datas are combined into a single dataset for analysis and try to create correlation between numbers

# Project Idea
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing 90 days of daily activity data. The goal is to explore patterns and correlations within the data, particularly focusing on screen time, step count, workdays, and exam days. Additionally, clustering techniques were applied to group similar days and gain further insights into distinct day types.

# Project Plan
1. Data Collection:
Data will be collected from Iphone and internet banking
   
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Data will be prepared for further usage and unnecesarry datas will be cleaned up for more accuracte finalization
   
3. Data Analysis:
Analyze the relationship between exam preparation days, working days and changes in other behaviors also iphone data; find the key trends.
   
4. Modeling and Correlation Analysis:
For better analysis and understanding modeling process will play important role; relation would be more observable with modeling
   
5. Visualization
Understanding the correlation, visualization of the correlation would ease the person understanding
   
6. Reporting
Gained information will be reported in accurate and organized way
