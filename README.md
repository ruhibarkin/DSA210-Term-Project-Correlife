# DSA210-Term-Project-Correlife
People mood changes dependent and indepently in period of time. If the relation of the mood change possibly explain by the specific data group than we may have solid reosaning about feelings and actions. By exploring data from my own step count, screen time, credit card spending, exam dates, and working days, this project seeks to understand the interplay between physical activity, digital habits and financial behavior (optional). Uncover how these dynmacis effect each other with the presence of daily life tasks and problems.


# Data Sources

1) Daily step count and walking distance from Iphone health
2) Daily Screen time for my both Iphone and MacBook usage (if needed specific application usage will be used)
3) Exam dates of my school and working dates of my job
4) My credit card expenditures (optional)

These datas will be combined into a single dataset for analysis and try to create correlation between problems and life problems

# Project Idea
This project will utilize data from an iPhoneâ€™s Health and Screen Time apps, personal credit card spending records, and manually logged exam and study dates.
By visualizing and modeling this data, the project hopes to provide actionable insights into improving balance and productivity in daily life.

# Project Plan
1. Data Collection:
Data will be collected from Iphone and internet banking
   
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Data will be prepared for further usage and unnecesarry datas will be cleaned up for more accuracte finalization
   
3. Data Analysis:
Analyze the relationship between exam preparation days, working days and changes in other behaviors also iphone data; find the key trends.
   
4. Modeling and Correlation Analysis:
For better analysis and understanding modeling process will play important role; relation would be more observable with modeling
   
5. Visualization
Understanding the correlation, visualization of the correlation would ease the person understanding
   
6. Reporting
Gained information will be reported in accurate and organized way
